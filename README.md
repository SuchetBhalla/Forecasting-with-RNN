# Forecasting-with-RNN
1. This program builds an RNN in Python using NumPy, then uses historical stock-price of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) up to 2020 to forecast prices in 2021. The created model captures all significant trends.
2. This project was an assignment given in my course on 'Deep Learning for NLP'.
3. The dataset 'GOOGL.csv' was distibuted by the teaching-asisstants, for training the RNN. I cannot affirm its authenticity.
